# VaultX (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)

VaultX â€” Secure Offline Presidential Vault  
**A hardened, offline-first secure journal built with Expo (React Native).**  
Designed for storing extremely sensitive notes where privacy, auditable integrity, and controlled destruction (panic wipe) are required.

---

## Overview

VaultX provides:

- AES-256-CBC encryption for content with HMAC-SHA256 integrity checks.
- A randomly-generated master key (256-bit) wrapped with a PBKDF2-derived key from your passphrase and stored in device SecureStore.
- Append-only entries (no in-app deletion). Only an explicit, confirmed **Panic Wipe** securely overwrites and removes data.
- Optional biometric gating (fingerprint / Face ID).
- Screen capture disabled while unlocked (where supported).
- Offline-only design â€” **no network requests, telemetry, or external APIs**.
- Tamper log / audit view so the user (or auditor) can verify the vault state and operations.

VaultX focuses on transparency and realism: what the UI shows is real cryptographic state (hashes, HMAC previews, timestamps), not fake animations.

## Features (key highlights)

- **Strong encryption**: AES-256-CBC for entry encryption + HMAC-SHA256 for integrity.
- **Key management**: Master key generated via secure RNG and wrapped by a PBKDF2-derived key (PBKDF2 with SHA-256, high iteration count).
- **Biometric gating**: Optional; still requires passphrase for decryption (defense-in-depth).
- **Append-only storage**: Entries are appended; in-app deletion is disallowed. Tamper log tracks unlocks, integrity checks, and critical operations.
- **Panic Wipe**: Multi-pass overwrite of stored data (in JS-land best-effort), removal of SecureStore keys and AsyncStorage entries, plus memory scrubbing of in-memory keys.
- **Screen-capture prevention**: Disable screenshots when the vault is unlocked (platform-specific).
- **No network surface**: Designed to be shipped without INTERNET permission and to run fully offline.
- **Auditability**: UI exposes truncated salts, HMACs, timestamps, and tamper-log entries so a user or auditor can quickly verify state.
- **Minimal, professional terminal-style UI**: Low animation, high clarity, tense-proof.

## Quick start (dev)

1. Clone repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArnabMistry/vaultx-secure-journal.git
   cd vaultx-secure-journal
   ```

2. Install:
   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Start dev:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

**Important (production)** â€” to remove any chance of network access and to ensure control over native permissions, build a custom native binary (recommended):
```bash
eas build --platform android
# or
expo run:android
```

Ensure AndroidManifest does not include `android.permission.INTERNET` (set `android.permissions: []` in app.json/eas.json) and verify final manifest. On iOS, verify entitlements and info.plist for no unnecessary network entitlements.

## Recommended dependencies

- expo (managed workflow)
- expo-crypto â€” secure random bytes & cryptographic primitives where appropriate
- expo-secure-store â€” storage of wrapped master key metadata
- expo-local-authentication â€” biometric support
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage â€” encrypted ciphertext/tamperlog storage (local)
- crypto-js â€” PBKDF2, AES (WordArray interoperable), HMAC (used carefully)

Install:
```bash
npx expo install expo-crypto expo-secure-store expo-local-authentication
npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage crypto-js
```

## Security notes & operational guidance

- **Passphrase**: Use a long, high-entropy passphrase (min 12 chars, recommended 16+; use passphrase managers or offline paper backups).
- **Device hardness**: The app assumes the OS/hardware is trusted. If device is compromised (rooted/jailbroken), secrecy can't be guaranteed.
- **Air-gapped use**: For highest assurance, use on an air-gapped device (no Wi-Fi/cellular) and ensure the final build has no INTERNET permission.
- **Hardware-backed keys**: Where possible, utilize hardware-backed Secure Enclave / Keystore (device-provided) for SecureStore keys.
- **No cloud backups**: Do not enable automatic backups of the app's storage â€” those can leak encrypted material or metadata. Configure build so that backups are disabled for the vault data.
- **Panic wipe caveats**: JavaScript overwrite cannot guarantee physical disk overwrites on flash storage (wear-leveling). Panic Wipe is the best-effort deletion strategy; for top-tier destruction consider physical measures or secure device management.

## Audit & transparency UI

VaultX intentionally exposes limited cryptographic state to build trust:
- truncated salt & iterations used for PBKDF2
- entry HMAC truncated preview (not full ciphertext)
- tamper log with timestamped events (unlock, integrity_check, entry_added, entry_viewed, locked, panic_wipe)
- last verified timestamp & result

This information helps an auditor or an executive quickly confirm the vault's integrity without revealing plaintext.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Open a PR with a clear security rationale for any cryptographic change.
4. All changes to crypto code must include unit tests and a security rationale doc in `/docs/security/`.
